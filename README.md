# My-Password-Application
So this application is for the people who, like me, have a hard time in remembering their passwords.
I did not use a lot of GUI tools or graphics. It is a plain, simple application that does the job.

FAQ:
Q : What is the application and how does it work?
A : This Application stores all your passwords for you using the shared preferences and displays it using listview.
Q : How secure is it?
A : Only the person who knows the login password can view all the passwords. Even if you view a password and minimize the application,
it won't be visible in the Recent Apps as well, so no peeking :P . The mode of shared preferences is set to Private, it cannot be accessed
by any other application.
Q : How to add a new entry?
A : Click on the Floating Action Button to Add/Modify an entry.
Q : How to modify an entry?
A : To change the username of password, just add a new entry with the same domain name.
Domain Name works as the key value. Adding multiple values for the same domain name will change the user names and passwords.
Q : How to delete a specific entry?
A : To delete an entry, long press on the item.
Q : How to change the login password?
A : To change the main password, go to options after signing in, click on Change Password.
