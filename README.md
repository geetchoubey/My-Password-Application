# My-Password-Application
So this application is for the people who, like me, have a hard time in remembering their passwords.</br>
I did not use a lot of GUI tools or graphics. It is a plain, simple application that does the job.

FAQ:</br>
Q : What is the application and how does it work? </br>
A : This Application stores all your passwords for you using the shared preferences and displays it using listview.</br>
Q : How secure is it?</br>
A : Only the person who knows the login password can view all the passwords. Even if you view a password and minimize the application,
it won't be visible in the Recent Apps as well, so no peeking :P . The mode of shared preferences is set to Private, it cannot be accessed
by any other application.</br>
